Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]
Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

I want to use selection sort!

// I'm going to be using a swap helper method today since array sorting algorithms mainly deal in swapping array elements in various ways. 

function swap (arr, i1, i2) {
    let temp = arr[i1];
    arr[i1] = arr[i2];
    arr[i2] = temp;
}

// Then, use my selectionSort. Which 'selects' the smallest element and moves it to index 0. bubbleSort would be another good option for this as it does the same thing in reverse.
