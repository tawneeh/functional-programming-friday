Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]
Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

* could use a Set - not an algorithm; Set is a built-in object

let arr = [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53];

function deduping(array) {
  return [...new Set(array)];
}

* using .filter()
let array = [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53];
let unique = array.filter((item, index) => array.indexOf(item) === index);
