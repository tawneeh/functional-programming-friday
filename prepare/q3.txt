Question #3: Compressing Strings
Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Input: "aaabccdddda"
Output: "3ab2c4da"

code:

function compress(string) {
  let compressedStr = "";
  let counter = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    counter++;
    if (string[i] != string[i + 1]) {
      if (counter > 1) {
        compressedStr += counter + string[i];
      } else {
        compressedStr += string[i]
      }
      counter = 0;
    }
  }
  return compressedStr;
}
