Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"
Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

let string = "Jasmine Ann Jones";

function urlThisString(string) {
  let arr = string.split('');
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === " ") {
      arr[i] = "%20";
    } else {
      return arr.join('');
    }
  }
  return arr.join('');
}

// upon testing, this doesn't actually change anything even though I'm attempting to reassign any space found afer looping as "%20" on line 15. no errors thrown in the console

let trimmed = string.trim(); -- extra white space edge case
