Functional Programming with JavaScript Independent Project

Prompt: write an algorithm that compresses repeated characters in a string. 
shows how many times the character is repeated. if the letter is only shown once then just display the letter

Input: "aaabccdddda"
Output: "3ab2c4da"

edge cases - input different data type. capital letters treated like a different character

tools:
JavaScript
for loop
counter 
if / else --- if this character is repeated ++ counter
	else --- return that character

pseudo code:

function compress(string) {
	let compressedStr = "";
  let counter = 0;
  for (through the entire string one character)
  
  if (this character is repeated string[i] counter++ )
  else (return the character)
  
  return compressedStr;
}

code:

function compress(string) { // "a"
	let compressedStr = "";
	let counter = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) { 
  	counter++;
    if (string[i] != string[i + 1] {
    	if (counter > 1) {
      	// compressedStr = counter + string[i];
      } else {
      	compressedStr += string[i]
    counter = 0;
    }
  }
  return compressedStr;
}
